.. _taup_time:

---------
TauP Time
---------

TauP Time takes a either a *.taup* file generated by TauP Create or a velocity model in
*.nd* or *.tvel* format and generates
travel times for specified phases through the given earth model.


The usage is:

.. literalinclude:: cmdLineHelp/taup_time.usage
  :language: text


The modelname is from :code:`modelname.taup`, a previously created file
from TauP Create or a :code:`modelname.nd` or :code:`modelname.tvel` velocity model file.

The phases are specified on the command line with the ``-p`` option,
in a phase file with the ``--phasefile`` option, or in a properties file.

For example:

.. literalinclude:: examples/taup_time_--mod_prem_-h_200_-p_S_P_--deg_57.4.cmd
  :language: text

gives you arrival times for S and P for a 200 kilometer
deep source at a distance of 57.4 degrees.
