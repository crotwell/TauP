                           The TauP Toolkit

            Flexible Seismic Travel-Time and Raypath Utilities
                              Version @short_version@

The TauP Toolkit is a seismic travel time calculator. In addition to travel
times, it can calculate derivative information such as ray paths through the
earth, pierce and turning points. It handles many types of velocity models and
can calculate times for virtually any seismic phase with a phase parser.
It is written in Java so it should run on any Java enabled platform.

The website for the TauP Toolkit is:

Documentation is available at [Read The Docs](https://taup.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), or in docs/manual directory of the distribution.

# Rebuilding

You should not need to rebuild TauP unless you are trying to help debug, but if you do, you can build it using the Gradle wrapper script.

```
./gradlew installDist
```

will build TauP into the build/install directory.
