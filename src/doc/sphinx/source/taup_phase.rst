TauP Phase
------------------

TauP Phase outputs a textual description of the path the
phase takes through the model. This is often helpful when trying to
understand TauP's phase nomenclature, especially in cases where it
differs from common seismological usage.

For example:

.. literalinclude:: examples/taup_phase_--mod_prem_-h_200_-p_PKiKP.cmd
  :language: text

.. literalinclude:: examples/taup_phase_--mod_prem_-h_200_-p_PKiKP
  :language: text


The usage is:
