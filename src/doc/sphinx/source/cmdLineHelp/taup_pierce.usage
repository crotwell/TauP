Usage: taup pierce [arguments]
  or, for purists, java edu.sc.seis.TauP.TauP_Pierce [arguments]

Arguments are:
-ph phase list     -- comma separated phase list
-pf phasefile      -- file containing phases

-mod[el] modelname -- use velocity model "modelname" for calculations
                      Default is iasp91.

-h depth           -- source depth in km

--stadepth depth   -- receiver depth in km
--scat[ter] depth deg   -- scattering depth and distance

Distance is given by:

-deg degrees       -- distance in degrees,
-km kilometers     -- distance in kilometers,
                      assumes radius of earth is 6371km,

or by giving the station and event latitude and lonitude,
                      assumes a spherical earth,

-sta[tion] lat lon -- sets the station latitude and longitude
-evt       lat lon -- sets the event latitude and longitude

or by giving the takeoff angle,
--takeoff angle    -- takeoff angle from the source
                      zero is down, 90 horizontal, 180 is up

or by giving the ray parameter,
--shootray param   -- ray parameter from the source in s/deg
                      up or down is determined by the phase


-az azimuth        -- sets the azimuth (event to station)
                      used to output lat and lon of pierce points
                      if the event lat lon and distance are also
                      given. Calculated if station and event
                      lat and lon are given.
-baz backazimuth   -- sets the back azimuth (station to event)
                      used to output lat and lon of pierce points
                      if the station lat lon and distance are also
                      given. Calculated if station and event
                      lat and lon are given.

--first            -- only output the first arrival for each phase, no triplications
-rev               -- only prints underside and bottom turn points, e.g. ^ and v
-turn              -- only prints bottom turning points, e.g. v
-under             -- only prints underside reflection points, e.g. ^

-pierce depth      -- adds depth for calculating pierce points
-nodiscon          -- only prints pierce points for the depths added with -pierce


-o [stdout|outfile]         -- output is redirected to stdout or to the "outfile" file
--prop [propfile]   -- set configuration properties
--debug             -- enable debugging output
--verbose           -- enable verbose output
--version           -- print the version
--help              -- print this out, but you already know that!
