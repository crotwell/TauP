.. _taup_time:

---------
TauP Time
---------

TauP Time takes a either a *.taup* file generated by TauP Create or a velocity model in
*.nd* or *.tvel* format and generates
travel times for specified phases through the given earth model.

The modelname is from :code:`modelname.taup`, a previously created file
from TauP Create or a :code:`modelname.nd` or :code:`modelname.tvel` velocity model file.

The phases are specified on the command line with the ``-p`` option,
in a phase file with the ``--phasefile`` option, or in a properties file.

For example:

.. literalinclude:: examples/taup_time_--mod_prem_-h_200_-p_S_P_--deg_57.4.cmd
  :language: text

gives you arrival times for S and P for a 200 kilometer
deep source at a distance of 57.4 degrees.


.. literalinclude:: examples/taup_time_--mod_prem_-h_200_-p_S_P_--deg_57.4
  :language: text

If you have a QuakeML file for earthquakes or a StationXML file for stations
and channels, you can use those to calculate the distances directly. For
example:

.. literalinclude:: examples/taup_time_--quakeml_my_midatlantic.qml_--staxml_my_stations.staml_-p_P_S.cmd
  :language: text

gives you arrival times for S and P for these earthquakes at those stations.
