TauP_Time
---------

TauP\_Time takes a either a {\texttt .taup} file generated by TauP\_Create or a velocity model in
{\texttt .nd} or {\texttt .tvel} format and generates
travel times for specified phases through the given earth model.


The usage is:

.. literalinclude:: cmdLineHelp/taup_time.usage


The modelname is from :code:`modelname.taup`, a previously created file
from TauP\_Create or a :code:`modelname.nd` or :code:`modelname.tvel` velocity model file.
If there is insufficient information given on the command line, then you start
in interactive mode, otherwise it assumes you only want one set of times.

The phases are specified on the command line with the -ph option,
in a phase file with the -pf option, or in a properties file.
The model, phases, depth and distance can be changed within the interactive
section of TauP\_Time.

For example:

.. literalinclude:: examples/taup_time_-mod_prem_-h_200_-ph_S_P_-deg_57.4.cmd

gives you arrival times for S and P for a 200 kilometer
deep source at a distance of 57.4 degrees.


.. literalinclude:: examples/taup_time_-mod_prem_-h_200_-ph_S_P_-deg_57.4
