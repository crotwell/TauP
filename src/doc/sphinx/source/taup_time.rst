.. _taup_time:

---------
TauP Time

TauP Time takes a either a *.taup* file generated by TauP Create or a velocity model in
*.nd* or *.tvel* format and generates
travel times for specified phases through the given earth model.

The modelname is from :code:`modelname.taup`, a previously created file
from TauP Create or a :code:`modelname.nd` or :code:`modelname.tvel` velocity model file.

The phases are specified on the command line with the ``-p`` option,
in a phase file with the ``--phasefile`` option, or in a properties file.

For example:

.. literalinclude:: examples/taup_time_--mod_prem_-h_200_-p_S_P_--deg_57.4.cmd
  :language: text

gives you arrival times for S and P for a 200 kilometer
deep source at a distance of 57.4 degrees.

  :language: text

If you have a QuakeML file for earthquakes or a StationXML file for stations
and channels, you can use those to calculate the distances directly. It is
often useful to use the ``--geodetic`` when using latitudes and longitudes
so that the distance calculation is more accurate. For
example:

.. literalinclude:: examples/taup_time_--quakeml_my_midatlantic.qml_--staxml_my_stations.staml_--geodetic_-p_P_S.cmd
  :language: text

gives you arrival times for S and P for these earthquakes at those stations.

.. literalinclude:: examples/taup_time_--quakeml_my_midatlantic.qml_--staxml_my_stations.staml_--geodetic_-p_P_S
  :language: text

Even more fun is to give a station id,
like :code:`--sid CO_HAW` or a
USGS event id, like :code:`--eid us7000pn9s`, and TauP will use the
`IRIS FedCat <https://service.iris.edu/irisws/fedcatalog/1/>`_ and
`USGS FDSN Event <https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/>`_
web services to get the station and event locations and depth. For example:


.. literalinclude:: examples/taup_time_--geodetic_--sid_CO_HAW_--eid_us7000pn9s_-p_SKS.cmd
  :language: text

gives you arrival times for SKS for this earthquake at station CO_HAW.
