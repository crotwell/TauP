TauP Curve
----------

TauP Curve creates a GMT style xy formated file of time versus distance.
This can be used to create the familar travel time curves, but for
only the specified phases and depth. The curves are linearly interpolated
between known sample points, and can thus be used to get a feel for the
coarseness of sampling. For example, curves for s, S, ScS and Sdiff
for a 500 kilometer deep event in PREM could be generated by:

.. literalinclude:: examples/taup_curve_-mod_prem_-h_500_-ph_s_S_ScS_Sdiff_--gmt.cmd

The :code:`-gmt` option prepends a GMT :code:`psxy` command to the output
file, creating a runnable script instead of just a data file.
The output is put in taup_curve.gmt by default, so to view the results:

\begin{verbatim}
sh taup_curve.gmt
\end{verbatim}

and you have a plot of the wavefronts in "taup_curve.pdf".

Alternatively, using --svg will generate an SVG plot of the same curves:

.. literalinclude:: examples/taup_curve_-mod_prem_-h_500_-ph_s_S_ScS_Sdiff_--svg.cmd


The usage is:

.. literalinclude:: cmdLineHelp/taup_curve.usage
