Pdiff:
  exists from 98.40 to 158.40 degrees.
  with degenerate ray parameter of    4.439 sec/deg.
  travel times from   819.64 to  1085.98 sec.

  Pdiff going down as a P in the crust/mantle, layer 0 to 5, depths 0.0 to 2889.0, then diffract
  Pdiff going flat as a P in the mantle, layer 5, depths  at 2889.0 (DIFF), then turn
  Pdiff going up   as a P in the crust/mantle, layer 5 to 0, depths 2889.0 to 0.0, then end
