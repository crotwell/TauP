  P going down as a P in the crust/mantle, layer 0 to 5, depths 0.0 to 2889.0, then transmit down
  K5153.9diff going down as a P in the outer core, layer 6, depths 2889.0 to 5153.9, then diffract
  K5153.9diff going flat as a P in the outer core, layer 6, depths  at 5153.9 (DIFF), then turn
  K5153.9diff going up   as a P in the outer core, layer 6, depths 5153.9 to 2889.0, then transmit up
