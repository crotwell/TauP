Vers  Date    Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.0  July 11, 2011
      1) Code modernization
      2) Build with Gradle
      3) Add taup_console for jython integration
1.1.7-grh1 Feb. 25, 2007 G. Helffrich/U. Bristol
      1) Eliminate use of log4j package; only used one place in code for
	 diagnostic message.  Diagnostic replaced with output under verbose
	 control.
      2) Add Makefile to main directory, change source directory Makefile to
	 invoke java compiler javac properly.
      3) Add -expert mode to TauP_{Time,Pierce,Path} to allow sources in the
	 core.  This is to provide a straightforward way to do point
	 scattering calculations.
      4) Fix typo in PREM model depths.
      5) Improve label positions on reverse branches in TauP_Curve.
      6) Add fortran call interface to subroutine call interface to TauP_Time
      7) Compile and install dynamically loadable library for interface routines
1.1.7  Apr 22, 2006
      1) Dumb rerelease due to compiling under java1.5
1.1.6  Apr 21, 2006
      1) Fix bug with corrupted data in little-endian sac files due to NaN translation by Java
1.1.5  Aug 3, 2005
      1) Fixed bug with pierce points and upgoing Pdiff leg
      2) Autodetect byte swapping in SAC files
      3) Put ray param into user headers in TauP_SetSac
1.1.4  Apr 5, 2002
      1) Added fix for models with S vel in Mantle higher than P vel in core, which happens in some Mars models. (Jadhav)
      2) Added time to both taup_pierce and taup_path (Rivera)
1.1.3  Jul 18, 2001
      1) Fixed bug with taup_path always using iasp91 (Pulliam)
1.1.2  Feb 9, 2001
      1) Allowed TauP GUI to be called from other tools
      2) Fixed bug in TauP_Path with outFile being null
      3) Added model text files to distribution(Ritsema)
1.1.1  April 19, 2000
      1) fixed problem with p^mP type phases for deep sources (Owens,Zandt,Ritsema)
      2) added getSlownessModel and getVelocityModel to TauModel and 
                getVelocityModel to SlownessModel
1.1    February 2, 2000
      1) several fixes to documentation (Snoke)
      2) now GPL'ed
      3) with source code
      4) add a GUI for times, pierce points and paths, not very advanced but 
               interesting
1.0.9 12/15/99
      1) fixed bug with taup_setsac not finding any arrivals
1.0.8 11/29/99
		1) fixed path bug for S at 180
		2) fixed SphericalCoords.lonFor() to be between -180 and 180
		3) changed PropertyLoader and TauModelLoader to use					getResourceAsStream to work with JDK1.2 where the				jar may not be in the classpath
		4) fixed bug with loading models from user generated jar files,
			manual said Models/modelname but code had 
			StdModels/modelname
		5) small changes and updates to manual, including adding
			license info
		6) added java2 install instructions and Mac and Windows
			 specific instructions
		7) fixed problems with jacl scripts
                8) added configurable precision for outputs, see standard 
                        properties
                9) redid formating of manual, used TimesRoman and pdf is now
                        usable, plus has hyperlinked table of contents, etc
                10) fixed null pointer bug with -help in TauP_Time
1.0.7 2/9/99   
      1) forgot to flush BufferedOutputWriter, resulting in no output at all
1.0.6	2/8/99 	1) fixed bug with very small layers and power law, now very 
		    small (< 1 micron) layers are just 0 time and distance
		    (Firpo)
		2) fixed bug with pierce depths being printed below turning 
		    depth (Ritsema)
		3) changed from printResult(StringWriter) to 
		    printResult(Writer) to fix out of memory bug
		4) added radius of earth to verbose option in 
		    taup_create (Owens)
		5) fixed bug with power law depth finder giving depths just
		    outside the layer
		6) general cleanup of source code
1.0.5  12/3/98 1)Speed improvement in TauP_SetSac, replaced readData with new
                   method directly calling intbitstofloat.
               2)fixed bug in TauP_Time, it was not depth correcting in some 
                   cases
1.0.4  11/23/98 Removed unneeded printlns from TauP_SetSac
1.0.3  11/17/98 Bug fix
               1) fixed (hopefully) a numerical instability in SlownessLayer
                   due to using the power law v=Ar^B in very thin layers
1.0.1  10/28/98 Bug fixes
               1) fixed bug in formater that rounded incorectly, 14.99 would
                   print as 14.0 when formatted %5.1f
               2) fixed taup_table bug when Pdiff was only arrival and distance
                   was greater than 105 degrees 
               3) fixed bug with depth of 15km in iasp91, indexP and indexS
                   were being incorrectly swapped

1.0    9/9/98  Public release
               1) added purist's phase names
               2) added taup_table tool
               3) fixed bug with taup_path not going all the way to the surface
               4) user's guide updated
               5) added get methods to Arrival and made attributes protected
               6) made time and distance calculations for layers more effecient
               7) added coarsely sampled qdt model for quick and dirty times
               8) several minor fixes

0.96.3 8/26/98 1) fixed taup.path to taup.model.path changes that were forgotten

0.96.2 8/25/98 1) added ScS to tts+

0.96.1 8/19/98 1) added check for max error due to linear interpolation

0.96.0 8/18/98 1) P410S is no illegal if this leg starts below the 410 and is downgoing.
                 This also makes P410P illegal in the same area, which seems reasonable
                 to me.
              3) space - comma bug when inputing new phases in interactive mode
              5) km/s is nomore, kmps is the only method now.
              8) taup_pierce goes backwards for phases that go between 180 and 360
                 degrees. (Fixed a week ago)
              9) P410P type phases have been fixed. They were getting a path that was
                 really Pv410P.

0.95.8  7/23/98 Changed phase naming convention so that moho, "m", phases are
                 treated like 410 type phases instead of like c and i phases
0.95.7  6/30/98 Fifth Beta
              fixed bug with P410S and P410s type phase names, was not creating the
                 correct "path" through the model.
              fixed ArrayOutOfBoundsException bug in SeismicPhase
              turned J phases on by default
0.95   5/13/98 Forth Beta
              changed taup.path property to taup.model.path
				  fixed bugs with improperly named Properties
              fixed bug with pPdiff at 0 source depth
              added missing PKKPdf type phases to the ttall phase option
0.94   5/8/98  Third beta 
              fixed path bug with PKIKP at 180 degrees
              Disabled path interpolation for 0.0 ray parameter at CoEarth
              disabled searching for 360n-dist if dist==180.0 to avoid
                 getting same phase twice
              Added native support for calling basic travel time routines 
                 from C
              Fixed bug for quiting taup_time, hanging when a quit was 
                 typed instead of q
              rewrote TauP_Time.recalcPhases so it only does it if needed, so
                 recalcPhases can be called from calculate without time penalty
              removed .phases file support in favor of more generic .taup file
                 the uses the standard Properties style of Java
              fixed bug with models whose name starts with a a number, eg 1066a
              added Alert class to handle warning and error reports to user,
                 ie System.err.println is replaced with a dialog if using a GUI
              fixed divide by zero bug in bullenDepthFor in SlownessLayer

0.93   3/25/98 Second beta 
              added support for sSdiff and PnPnPn type of phases
              Docs updated to include programming support.
              TauPDaemon in distribution, but not in docs.
              Cleaned up the output of TauP_Pierce, removed radius as output

0.92   3/12/98 First Beta release
